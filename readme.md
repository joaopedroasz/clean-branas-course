# Clean Code and Clean Architecture Course.

This documentation will be updated as the course and project progresses.

## What is this?

This is the repository for the course [Clean Code and Clean Architecture](http://app.branas.io).
Here, I will register my steps and progress in the course.

In this course, the instructor let the students free to use any language and framework they want. So expect to see some differences between some patterns and implementations from teacher's code, but always following Clean Code, Clean Architecture and TDD principles.

### Content:

In this project, the following topics will be covered:

- SOLID Principles;
- Separation of Concerns;
- Test Driven Development (TDD);
- YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it);
- DRY (Don't repeat yourself);
- Strongly Typed Code (Typescript);
- DDD (Domain Driven Design);
- Hexagonal Architecture;

### Technologies:

- NodeJS (16.x);
- Typescript;
- Postgres;
- Prisma;
- Vitest;
- Axios;
- Docker;
- GraphQL;
- Apollo Server;

### How to run:

You only need to have Docker installed in your machine. Then, just run the following commands:

- Run development database:

```bash
yarn db:dev:up
```

- Run development GraphQL server:

```bash
yarn dev:server
```

Your termal will show the GraphQL playground URL. Open it in your browser and start playing with the API. :smile:
