# Clean Code and Clean Architecture Course.

This documentation will be updated as the course and project progresses.

## What is this?

This is the repository for the course [Clean Code and Clean Architecture](http://app.branas.io).
Here, I will register my steps and progress in the course.

In this course, the instructor let the students free to use any language and framework they want. So expect to see some differences between some patterns and implementations from teacher's code, but always following Clean Code, Clean Architecture and TDD principles.
